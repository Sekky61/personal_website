            <p>
                Hello.
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Michal and I am a programmer with a passion for crafting efficient and elegant solutions to complex problems.
                I have a bachelors degree from Faculty of Information Technology of the Brno University of Technology.
                No experience working in the industry (yet).
            </p>
            <p>
                I am skilled in a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including Rust, Python, and JavaScript,
                and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
                In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field and exploring new tools and concepts.
