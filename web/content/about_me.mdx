Hello.

I am a programmer who enjoys web technologies and admires low-level and systems programming. I love exploring new languages and have a lot of opinions about the world of softwareâ€”opinions I'm excited to have challenged by new experiences.

## Education

I hold a master's degree from the Faculty of Information Technology at Brno University of Technology.

## What's in my toolbox?

My favorite technologies so far are **Zig**, **Rust**, **TypeScript**, and **React**. Recently, I fell in love with **Neovim**, **Nix**, and the window manager **Hyprland**. I love automating things with scripts.

I also have experience with **Java**, **C**, **C++**, and **Python**.

## What do I do in my free time?

Outside of computers, I enjoy reading sci-fi, playing the occasional video game, and lifting weights. I've also recently discovered a passion for bouldering. ðŸ§—
