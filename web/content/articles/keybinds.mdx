## Intro

The sheer amount of configuration options Hyprland makes available to their users is stunning.
It's also accompanied by thorough documentation, which I do not take for granted.
In this article, we'll focus on one particularly versatile feature: [keybinds](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/).

We'll use Nix, a tool that turns configuring software into a delight.
Nix lets you write configurations in its declarative language, translating them into files the target program expects.
In other words, instead of embedding one chunky string representing hyprland.conf (the Hyprland configuration file), we can do something like this:

Insert 1

But did you notice?
The binds are just strings.
I cannot do much else with strings.
Ferb, I know what we're doing today.
Let's make our own structured keybind options.

This is the configuration interface we will end up with at the end of this article:

Insert 2

But why, I hear you ask.
I can see you already wrote your keybinds, just let it go and do something productive\!
This is of no use.

Sure (ouch), maybe.
But that is not all.
I have a usecase: to display all the keybinds in a cheat sheet.
Sure, I could just copy them, maybe let an LLM turn them to JSON.
But I would not keep them in sync, I know myself.

## Custom Configuration Options in Hyprland

While it's possible to integrate custom configuration directly into Hyprland's home-manager options (`wayland.windowManager.hyprland.settings`), I prefer to create a separate namespace for better organization and visibility.
This approach makes it easier to query and maintain custom options.

### Understanding NixOS Modules

To implement custom configuration, we first need to create a NixOS module.
Modules in NixOS serve as groupings of related configuration settings and can:
- Import other modules
- Define new configuration options
- Implement configuration logic

For those new to Nix, modules can present a challenge.
It was certainly hard for me.
Two key insights that helped me understand modules better:
1. Nix provides several syntactic shortcuts that aren't immediately obvious (omitting `options` etc.)
2. Options defined in one module become automatically available to other modules without explicit imports (this was surprising!)

### Module Structure for Keybindings

Below is the basic framework for our keybinding options module.

Now is the time to decide on the data types. I need a list of keybinds. A keybind will be an object (attrset in Nixspeak). Now for the requirements.

There will be many, many keybinds, so it should be concise.

Another requirement is to be able to bind multiple key combinations to a command and multiple commands to a key combination. This would reduce repetition and I feel it will be worth the added complexity.

The syntax should map clearly to Hyprland's syntax. Firstly to make the conversion code simple, but also to make sure anything can be expressed in the new option. I would like to diverge in one way, though. The flags for a bind are one letter and they are suffixed to the word bind, like this:

Insert 3.5  
Home-manager does it like this:  
Insert 3.6

I want flags that are readable (full words instead of a letter) and per bind (unlike what home manager encourages).

This is the shape I arrived at, using Typescript syntax.

Insert 4

Related are well-designed default values, which will further help to keep the config short.

Now that I have a clear picture in mind, let's express the type in NixOS module options.

Insert 5

Ok, a lot is happening here. Most of it is understandable just from the attribute names, but I'd like to point out that submodule is the way to add an attrset as a child type. If there are other ways, I'd love to know them, consider leaving an issue on Github.

In general, my recommendation is not to ask LLM’s about Nix specifics, rather use the Github’s code search and filter by Language:Nix. You can find how other people are using the specific expression you have trouble with.

## Converting custom configuration to Hyprland's syntax

Now is the time to whip out your skills from the university Haskell course. I like to break my code into named statements to imitate the imperative style I am so used to.

Let's not spend much time on the specifics, though. That is not the focus of the article.

## Generating a cheatsheet

With the keybinds working as expected, I will reuse the same definition for generating a cheatsheet.

I use Ags for all my desktop shell needs. What I need is a new window, which would be hidden by default and show up after a shortcut. This is the gist:

Insert 6

I didn't spend much time on the styling. After all, I know most of the binds by heart by now. I put some effort into sorting the keys into groups by keywords from the description. Good enough for now. Let me not forget to add the shortcut:

Insert 7

And here we go. No repetition, nocely configured.

## Results

The ability to add shortcuts from another module was not lost. For example, you can conditionally add a shortcut to launch a program only if the program is installed.

Example: launch chrome or discord based on what is installed
